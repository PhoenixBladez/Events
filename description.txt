Various Weathers is a small mod that adds multiple minor weather effects to spice up Day/Night cycles. All weather has a chance of occuring at dawn/dusk, or when the world is opened. Weather effects tend to last for a whole day/night. Here are some of the weather effects you will see:

- Thunderstorms
- Meteor Showers
- Acid Rain
- Heat Waves
- ...and 16 more!
